# Ensemble-based-property-price-prediction-using-stacking-neural-nets-SVR-boosting-feature-selection
This project predicts real estate prices using an ensemble of models like SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. A Stacking Regressor combines their outputs, while Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection boosts performance and model accuracy.
